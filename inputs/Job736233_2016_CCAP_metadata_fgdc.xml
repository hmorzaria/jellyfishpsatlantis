                The NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) produces national standardized land cover and change products for the coastal regions of the U.S.  C-CAP products inventory coastal intertidal areas, wetlands, and adjacent uplands with the goal of monitoring changes in these habitats, on a one-to-five year repeat cycle. The timeframe for this metadata is reported as 2016-Era, but the actual dates of the Landsat imagery used to create the land cover may have been acquired a few years before or after each era.  These maps are developed utilizing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, and can be used to track changes in the landscape through time.  This trend information gives important feedback to managers on the success or failure of management policies and programs and aid in developing a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes. This understanding allows for the prediction of impacts due to these changes and the assessment of their cumulative effects, helping coastal resource managers make more informed regional decisions. NOAA C-CAP is a contributing member to the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium and C-CAP products are included as the coastal expression of land cover within the National Land Cover Database.
This data set is a raster file with 5093 columns and 7409 rows and may have been mosaiced, reprojected, and clipped from the original tiles. The data set was generated from a larger data set and includes all valid data within the requested geographic bounds.

         <purpose>C-CAP is dedicated to the development, distribution, and application of land cover and change data for the coastal regions of the U.S. This effort is being conducted in close coordination with state coastal management agencies, the interagency Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium, and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD).</purpose>
