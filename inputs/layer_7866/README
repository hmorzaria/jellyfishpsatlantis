NOTICE
------

The data included in this archive was produced by extracting the data stored in
ERMA.  As such, it is not the original source file that was uploaded into ERMA, 
and used to create a layer.

The original file is not available, as this data was uploaded prior to ERMA
entering "production" status, and at the time of upload ERMA was not 
archiving uploaded datafiles (it was processing them and storing the processed
data, then discarding the source data.)

Rather than reference this file, it is recommended that you view the metadata 
specific to the layer this file was provided with, and contact the layer
creator for the original source data.

This data may be incomplete or inaccurate, and is therefore not suitable for
decision processing, decision support, or fit for any purpose aside from archiving
the information stored within the ERMA system.
